create "Notifications" component that pops up when Notifications # is clicked.
Notifications component takes the notifs object returned from fetch request and maps
a p to each key to display the link to the page where the comment is and the number of new comments.

The Notifications # itself displays the TOTAL number from each key in the object.

When the Notifications component is opened, a DELETE request is sent to the get-notifs API route,
which deletes the notifs field in the user document, then forEach's through each show and deletes
the notifs field for that user in each show's document
